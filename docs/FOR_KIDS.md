# Azalea for Kids! 🌺

Azalea is super easy to learn! You can write code that works everywhere.

## Your First Program

```azalea
say Hello World!
```

That's it! Just run it and see "Hello World!" appear.

## Numbers

You can use numbers or words:

```azalea
form num age from 8
form num count from ten
form num price from 5.99
```

All of these work!

## Making Things Happen

### Say Something

```azalea
say I love coding!
say 42
say Hello
```

### Count Things

```azalea
loop 5 do
    say step
end
```

This counts: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

### Make Decisions

```azalea
form num age from 10

if age over 5 do
    say You are big!
end
```

## Making a Button

```azalea
call view button "Click Me" do
    say You clicked!
end
```

So easy!

## Making a Website

```azalea
act home req do
    give "Welcome!"
end

call serve get "/" give home
call serve on 3000
```

Now you have a website!

## Math

```azalea
form num a from 10
form num b from 5

say a plus b    // 15
say a minus b   // 5
say a times b   // 50
say a div b     // 2
```

## Fun Examples

### Count to 10

```azalea
loop 10 do
    say step
end
```

### Greet Friends

```azalea
act greet name do
    say Hello
    say name
end

call greet "Alice"
call greet "Bob"
```

### Simple Game

```azalea
form num score from 0

loop 5 do
    score give score plus 1
    say Score
    say score
end
```
